Intituion:
 Traverse the graphs level by level ..This is like implementation of bfs in undirected graph

Approach:
We use ArrayList to display the elements
create a queue and add the elements and their adj node like bfs 
Get all adjacent vertices of the dequeued vertex s
If a adjacent has not been visited, then mark it visited and enqueue it

Time Complexity: O(N) + O(2E), Where N = Nodes, 2E is for total degrees as we traverse all adjacent nodes.
Space Complexity: O(3N) ~ O(N), Space for queue data structure visited array and an adjacency list
