Intuition:
The intuition is that we need to figure out the boundary land cells, go through their connected land cells and mark them as visited.
The sum of all the remaining land cells will be the answer.

Approach:
Breadth First Search, BFS is a traversal technique where we visit the nodes level-wise
Queue: Define a queue and insert the coordinates of the cell <row, column> which are in the boundary and are marked as 1
Visited array: an array initialized to 0 indicating unvisited cells, apart from the ones in the boundary which are already in the queue ds. 
And Traverse and mark vis[][]=1..and check and return no of remain unvisted lands
