Intuition:
The intuition is the brute force of filling colours using any traversal technique, just make sure no two adjacent nodes have the same colour.
If at any moment of traversal, we find the adjacent nodes to have the same colour, it means that there is an odd cycle, or it cannot be a bipartite graph. 

Approach:
we will be solving it using BFS traversal
That we can use the simple for loop concept  to call the traversals for unvisited nodes.
And color with adj nodes if adj nodes color are same return false 

Time Complexity: O(V + 2E)
Space Complexity: O(V)
