Intuition:
In a Directed Cyclic Graph, during traversal, if we end up at a node, which we have visited previously in the path, that means we came around a circle and ended up at this node, which determines that it has a cycle.

Approach:
We will be solving it using DFS traversal. DFS goes in-depth
And when there are no further nodes to traverse in the current path
Then it backtracks on the same path and traverses other unvisited nodes. 

Time Complexity: O(V+E)+O(V)
Space Complexity:O(2N)
