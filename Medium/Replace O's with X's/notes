Intuition:
The intuition is that we start from boundary elements having ‘O’ and go through its neighboring Os in 4 directions and mark them as visited to avoid replacing them with ‘X’. 

Approach:
We can follow either of the traversal techniques as long as we are starting with a boundary element and marking 
all those Os connected to it. We will be solving it using DFS traversal, if you want go with bfs also
DFS is a traversal technique that involves the idea of recursion.., and when there are no further nodes to traverse in the current path,
then it backtracks on the same path and traverses other unvisited nodes.

Time Complexity: O(N*M)
Space Complexity:tack space takes up N x M locations at max.
