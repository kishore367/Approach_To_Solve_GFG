Intitution:
From the centre of the image (with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1)), all pixels connected by a path of the same colour as the starting pixel are colored with the new colourNote the bottom corner is not colored 2, 
because it is not 4-directionally connected to the starting pixel.

Approach:
To perform a "flood fill", consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally 
To the starting pixel of the same colour as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same colour as the starting pixel), and so on.
We know about both the traversals, Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS). 
We can follow BFS also, where we start at a given point and colour level wise, i.e., we go simultaneously to all its neighbours.

Time Complexity: O(NxM + NxMx4) ~ O(N x M)
Space Complexity: O(N x M) + O(N x M)
